Use Case: NFT batch minting from one Contract to multiple addresses

Deploy Auction Smart Contract:

 1: Deploy a smart NFTcontract.sol

 2: Make a Batch.sol ready using instructions: https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/pallets-precompiles/precompiles/batch/#finding-a-contract-interactions-call-data

 3: Get the call data and set into the batch all field


By batching these transactions together, you can streamline the process of creating and managing NFT minting on the Moonbeam network. Batching allows users to create minting with a single atomic transaction, ensuring consistency and reducing the number of individual transactions required.
