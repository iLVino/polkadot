Use Case: NFT Auction Platform

Deploy Auction Smart Contract:

Transaction 1: Deploy a smart contract that represents an auction platform for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This transaction involves deploying the auction contract bytecode and any necessary constructor arguments, such as the contract owner's address and initial configuration parameters.
Create Auction:

Transaction 2: Invoke a method on the auction smart contract to create a new auction for an NFT. This transaction involves calling a function on the contract, providing the necessary details such as the NFT's address, the token ID, the starting bid, and the auction duration.
Place Bids:

Transaction 3: Invoke a method on the auction smart contract to place bids on an active auction. This transaction involves calling a function on the contract, specifying the auction ID and the bid amount.
End Auction:

Transaction 4: Invoke a method on the auction smart contract to end an auction. This transaction involves calling a function on the contract, providing the auction ID. The contract should handle the logic of determining the winning bid and transferring the NFT to the winning bidder.
By batching these transactions together, you can streamline the process of creating and managing NFT auctions on the Moonbeam network. Batching allows users to create auctions, place bids, and end auctions with a single atomic transaction, ensuring consistency and reducing the number of individual transactions required.

Remember to adapt the example code provided earlier to include the specific details of each transaction, such as the auction contract's bytecode, function calls, parameters, and any additional logic required for your NFT auction platform on the Moonbeam network
